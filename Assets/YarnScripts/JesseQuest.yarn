Jesse McCormack: Here is the start of my quest!
Aria: Ok fine... Here's the gist.
Aria: There seems to be a weird coincidence between these slimes and the missing Capsule People.
Aria: Capsule People go missing, slimes keep getting richer.
Aria: They even have a king now! And a town! They're slimes, what do they need a town for!
Aria: And they call it "The Hub"... Odd.
->Player: I don't follow.
    Aria: Do you know what trafficking is?
    ->Player: Yes
        Aria: It seems these slimes are capable of absorbing Capsule People and spitting them back out later.
        Aria: From there, they smuggle these people and sell them for profit.
        Aria: They're cute, but devious little bastards..
        Aria: Rumour has it, there may even be some portals nearby they use to move without being caught.
        ->Player: Is there anything I can do?
            Aria: Well you could catch these slimes in the act... 
            Aria: but I think it'd be easier to find the portals first.
            ->Player: I can do that.
                Aria: If you happen to find them, report back to me.
                <<jump Done>>
            ->Player: I've already destroyed the portals!
                Aria: Then our work here is done.

            ->Player: That seems a bit above my paygrade.
                Aria: Do what you must, then.
                <<jump Done>>    
        ->Player: Ok well... good luck with all that.
            <<jump Done>>
    ->Player: No....?
        Aria: Ok, well then it's time for you to get lost.
        <<jump Done>>
-> Player: Ok, I think I'm picking up what you're throwing down....
    Aria: Swell. If you're interested in helping out, I could use you.
    Aria: All you have to do is catch these Slimes doing something... illegal.
    Aria: However, it may be easier if you try and find these portals I hear rumours about.
    ->Player: Portals?
        Aria: They seem to be using portals to assist their criminal activities.
        Aria: Come back if you hear anything.
    ->Player: You got it!
        Aria: Very well. be on your way.
    ->Player: I've already destroyed the portals!
        Aria: Then our work here is done.
